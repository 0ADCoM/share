Dear Councillors,


it's encouraging to see your efforts turning the tide when 0A.D. faced a dark time due to RedFox'
leaving and criticism arising as to how to deal with the fundraiser's treasury.

The message of the shadowwolf is one that lifts my heart, enthusiasm is the key to motivation. Motivation is the key to make our dreams come true.


My humble self currently is not seen frequently in the forums. Be assured my bow is still drawn in support of our plans. I have taken this step to force me off the forum so as to not fail with short term goals that I'm obliged to fulfill for university's goodwill.


You can assure my warmest welcome to our recruits. No matter the skills, no matter the time spent, their reinforcement can't be thanked enough at all times.


The Council's members written pamphlet has a nice and gentle appearance to me. Don't let yourself fall only because criticism arises (be it in form of crying images or forum members laughing at you or trying to discourage you) - criticism is a healthy sign, helpful and not only not forbidden but wanted. 

My bow is still with you to protect all Councillors the number of which has grown already and mostly unexpected to many --  with incredible recruits that take new oakenshielded seats in our midst, level at level.

Enthusiastic and thinking about making triggers a higher priority as to give us more means to create the worlds we envision.


Hephaestion, Councillor
